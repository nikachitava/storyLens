# Story Lens

## Description

Storylens is a full-stack web application built with React.js, Node.js, and MySQL. This project allows users to create their private blog. It includes features such as user authentication, CRUD operations and a responsive UI.
Its my first full stack projects so I know there are many mistakes. I am sharing this project cause I need feedback for experienced developers to develop my skills.
